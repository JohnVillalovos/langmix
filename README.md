# langmix

Create multilanguage subtitles by merging two SRT video subtitles into one.
The tool is handy for language learning.

Subtitles from the first file will be shown at top (with smaller letters),
and subtitles from the second at bottom (with regular letters) of the screen.

Both GUI and featured command line interfaces are available.

Intended to use with VideoLAN player. Unfortunately new VLC 3 and above doesn't support font tags in SRT files, so [version 2.2.8 is latest compatible](https://get.videolan.org/vlc/2.2.8/).
